# Panther

## Overview

**Panther** is a user interface application developed as part of a third-year industrial engineering project with a specialization in electronics. The primary goal was to create a remote control interface for our electronic system, facilitating seamless interaction between the user and the hardware components.

## Project Objectives

- Design and implement a user-friendly interface to monitor and control the electronic project remotely.
- Enable real-time data visualization and command execution.
- Ensure reliable communication between the software application and the electronic hardware.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language for application development.
- **JavaFX**: Framework for building the graphical user interface.
- **Maven**: Project management and build automation tool.
- **Serial Communication Libraries**: For interfacing with hardware components.

## Usage

Upon launching the application, users can:

- Monitor real-time data from the electronic hardware.
- Send commands to control various aspects of the electronic system.
- Visualize system status and performance metrics.
